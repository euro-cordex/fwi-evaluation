# Fire Weather Index Evaluation

This repository is intended to centralize the coordination of the Fire Weather Index study, as part of the broader [EURO-CORDEX joint evaluation](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation) effort.

The repo is under construction. If you have any topics, questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open a new issue!

## Preparing a working environment

All the scripts and notebooks are reproducible at the existing jsc-cordex data exchange infrastructure at JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC). More details for data exchange and access are available [here](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation#data-exchange).

To this aim, the climate4R conda metapackage must be previously installed and activated:

```
conda install -c conda-forge r-climate4r
```

Once succesfully installed:

```
conda activate climate4r
```

The rest of instructions for running jupyter-lab notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation?tab=readme-ov-file#starting-jupyter-lab)
